        <!-- if we declare variables in more than one file then it creates naming conflicts -->
        <!-- two variables with siliar name -->
        <!-- solve this problems using feature of javascript called modules -->
        <!-- steps to create the module -->
        <!-- ->create a file -->
        <!-- ->Don't load the file with <script> </script> -->
        <!-- Any variable create inside the file will be contained inside the file -->
        <!-- get a variable out of a file below are steps -->
        <!-- ->Add type=module attribute in html script line
        ->export word add in front of variable that want to export
        ->import add the import lie along with path of that variable
        to work the module open with live server
        if I import the variable in the same file that have the same variable then it creates the naming conflicts
        import{cart as mycart}// just rename the variable to solve the problem
        modules are better way to organize the code
