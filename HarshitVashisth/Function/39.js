// Function Declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code.
// Function Expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be called before they are defined.


// A function expression in JavaScript is a way to define a function as part of a larger expression, 
// typically by assigning it to a variable.
