// Intro to Ajax, HTTP Request
// asynchronous javascript and XML
// XML is a data format
// HTTP request is used to perform communication between client and server

// client and server used http to communicate
// with AJAX web application can send and retrieve data asynchronously(in the background)
//without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page

// we dont use XML anymore 
// we use JSON format


//we have three common ways to create and send request to the server
// 1)xmlHttp request - old way
// 2)fetch API - (new way of doing)
// 3)axios(this is third party library)
